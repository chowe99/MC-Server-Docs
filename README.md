## Client-side Only Mods
You can install whichever client-side only mods you want to your 'Fabulously Optimized' instance, but here's a few suggestions:

- [Simple HUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/simplehud)

### Visual Mods
**Resource Packs:**
- [Default HD 128x](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/default-hd-128x/versions) (Not as potent as shaders, barely impacts performance)

**Shaders:**
- [Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)
- [Dramatic Skies](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/dramatic-skys)

## Client-Server
Client-server mods need to be installed on the client and the server to function properly, however some mods like Plasmo aren't necessary to install and the server can still be accessed with a vanilla client.
- [Plasmo Voice](https://modrinth.com/plugin/plasmo-voice?version=1.21.5&loader=fabric)
  - Press 'v' (default) to access Plasmo's settings, particularly your proximity distance along with your push-to-talk/voice settings:

  - Use [these](https://github.com/plasmoapp/pv-addon-groups?tab=readme-ov-file#commands) commands to create group voice chats which don't have proximity limits.
  - See [Issues](https://github.com/chowe99/MC-Server-Setup/edit/main/README.md#server-side-modlist)

## Known Issues
### Plasma Voice
Sometimes shaders can interact with the proximity voice mod and cause crashes, if you experience this, set entity icons to hidden:
